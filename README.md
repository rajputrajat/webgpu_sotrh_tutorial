# Progress

## version 0.5.0

* RAM usage is still same as triangle - 173 MB

## version 0.4.0

* debug build with Intel 630
* cpu usage - 1.5 %
* RAM usage - 173 MB
* GPU usage - 5 - 8 %
* not sure why this is happening. need to understand why there is so much memory
  usage for this simple program.

* when high performance was enabled on laptop, nVidia was still not enables,
  instead DX12 was choosen as backend in place of Vulkan.
* also there is some memory issue. RAM usage is keep on increasing at around 50MBps

* release build with Intel 630
* RAM usage - 10 MB less than debug build

## version v0.1.0 to v0.2.0

* debug build with Intel 630
* cpu usage - 1.5 %
* RAM usage < 38 MB
* GPU usage - 5 - 8 %
